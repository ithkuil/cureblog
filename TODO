 similar to htmlfield but instead of entering rich text during data entry mode,
 goes into rich text mode during design mode so that you can specify the way the text is displayed

 then save its text to the record on blur

  use phantomjs to access that page
  and then store a cached version

  copy the html out of the phantomjs page
  and send to app
  or phantomjs called from nodejs

provide links to static pages on design
  probably when in edit mode
